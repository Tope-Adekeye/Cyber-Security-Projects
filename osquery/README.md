## 🎯 Overview

Osquery is a revolutionary **SQL-powered operating system instrumentation framework** that transforms endpoint monitoring and security operations. This powerful tool exposes operating system data as a high-performance relational database, enabling security teams to query system state, monitor for threats, and conduct forensic investigations using familiar SQL syntax across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

### 🚀 **Key Features**
- **SQL-Based Querying**: Query operating system data using standard SQL syntax
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Unified interface across Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous system state monitoring and alerting
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for custom table implementations
- **Performance Optimized**: High-performance data collection with minimal system impact
- **Rich Schema**: 200+ built-in tables covering processes, network, files, users, and more
- **Flexible Deployment**: Ad-hoc queries, scheduled monitoring, or API integration

## 🛠️ **Security Monitoring Capabilities**

### **Core System Tables**
- **Process Monitoring**: Running processes, deleted executables, process trees
- **Network Analysis**: Open connections, listening ports, routing tables
- **File System**: File hashes, permissions, timestamps, and access patterns
- **User Activity**: Logged-in users, authentication events, privilege changes
- **Registry**: Windows registry monitoring and change detection
- **Hardware**: System information, CPU, memory, and device enumeration

### **Advanced Security Tables**
- **Certificate Management**: SSL/TLS certificates and trust chains
- **Browser Security**: Extensions, plugins, and security settings
- **Kernel Modules**: Loaded drivers and kernel-level components
- **Startup Items**: Services, scheduled tasks, and persistence mechanisms
- **Hash Analysis**: File integrity monitoring and malware detection
- **Event Logging**: System events and audit trail analysis

## 📋 **Professional Use Cases**

- **Persistence Detection**: Identification of malware persistence mechanisms

## 🎮 **Query Examples**

### **Security Monitoring Queries**
```sql
-- Find processes with network connections
SELECT p.name, p.pid, p.path, l.port, l.address 
FROM processes p 
JOIN listening_ports l ON p.pid = l.pid;

-- Detect suspicious process execution
SELECT * FROM processes 
WHERE on_disk = 0 OR path LIKE '%temp%' OR path LIKE '%appdata%';

-- Monitor file hash changes
SELECT path, md5, sha1, sha256 
FROM hash 
WHERE path IN ('/etc/passwd', '/etc/shadow', 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts');

-- Check for privilege escalation
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE type = 'local' AND uid = 0;
```

### **Compliance and Auditing**
```sql
-- Audit user access and permissions
SELECT u.username, u.uid, g.groupname 
FROM users u 
JOIN user_groups ug ON u.uid = ug.uid 
JOIN groups g ON ug.gid = g.gid;

-- Monitor critical file access
SELECT f.path, f.mode, f.uid, f.gid, u.username 
FROM file f 
JOIN users u ON f.uid = u.uid 
WHERE f.path LIKE '/etc/%' OR f.path LIKE 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\%';

-- Check system configuration
SELECT * FROM os_version;
SELECT * FROM system_info;
```

### **Threat Hunting Queries**
```sql
-- Hunt for lateral movement indicators
SELECT * FROM arp_cache 
WHERE mac IN (
  SELECT mac FROM arp_cache 
  GROUP BY mac 
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);

-- Detect persistence mechanisms
SELECT * FROM startup_items 
WHERE status = 'enabled';

-- Monitor DNS queries for C2 detection
SELECT * FROM dns_resolvers;
```
